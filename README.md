In sixth grade, I began noticing balding spots on my head and heaps of hair on my desk. After catching myself, I finally realized that I was unconsciously tearing my hair out, motivated mainly by surges of stress and feelings of inadequacy.

This condition, which I later identified as trichotillomania, never went away: tearing my hair out while out in social settings, taking examinations, and even when I'm trying to sleep is now nearly as natural as breathing oxygen.  

I'm happy to say that I've prevented the mental strains of trichotillomania from affecting my academic and social abilities as much as I could, and I see my hard work paying off in my grades! However, as a trichotillomania sufferer for nearly seven years now, I felt a calling towards innovating an app that helps those who feel or felt the same as me– and this  is the brainchild of my passion. Coded throughout the years, this initiative hopes to educate and support our users– regardless of whether or not you have trichotillomania :) 

First priority is to educate! I'll give a super quick synposis on what exactly is trichotillomania and how this app is battling against it. 

And thank you for being here. <3

Though this condition is, unforunately, quite common, no cause has been scientifically pinpointed. Researchers do mainly note, however, that stress and anxiety definitely make it worse. Aside from stress, anxiety, and depression, they also believe that trichotillomania could be related to OCD or passed on genetically– but for now, all we can do is guess.

Trichotillomania users have reported to often suffer from:
* Increased feelings of depression and anxiety
* Low self esteem.
* Poor body image due to hair loss and skin damage.
* Negative emotions; shame, etc

As a sufferer of trichotillomania myself, I can confirm that these researched tips have either 1) been recommended by multiple sources or 2) recommended by myself :) Try these yourself:
* Wear a bandana to bed. *
* Reward yourself after several days (or hours) of being pull free. *
* Be patient with yourself.
* Join a support group.
* Talk to another person with Trichotillomania.
* Wet down your hair. This will make it really hard to pull out your hair since it will be slippery.
* Buy a fidget toy. *
* Find other things to do with your hands such as knitting, crocheting, or cross stitch.
* <b>Imagine your life without Trichotillomania and with hair.**</b> 
* Wear a hoodie to bed as a barrier to pulling.
* <b>Help others, which in turn will help you. ** </b>
* Watch shows and documentaries about trichotillomania to learn new techniques.*
* Read everything you can on the internet about trichotillomania and the treatment plans to deal with it.

As I was creating this app, I thought: what would have helped me through trichotillomania? And how could I communicate these features... digitially?

Currently, this open-source code has:
* a personal, secured history of trichotillomania record; can take and record images and rank your progress with star features
* find fellows who sufferred similar and chat with them securely with text, or images, or videos! 

I'm still constantly improving my app and adding more and more features. Right now, I'm conducting some AI research; I'll be able to incorporate AI-based emotion detection and tracking records pattern recognition to this app very soon -:)

Behind this app is so much time, so much effort, and, above all, so much help. Thank you so, so much to:
* "Mr. Brain" from Youtube! His tutorial of<a href="https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com/course/Firebase-Chat-Messenger"> "Firebase Chat Massenger"</a> made it possible for my code to even work and have functional pages. Please check out his account!
* An open-source "cooking recipe" code tutorial that I used to record images, ratings, and texts for every daily entry!
* A great <a href="https://www.inspiritscholars.com/"> Stanford/MIT AI Scholars program </a> I attended last Winter to code emotional detection as a final project! Highly recommend to check them out.
* Of course, my wonderful, intelligent, and selfless dad. His help cannot be wholely explained in words because this app literally wouldn't exist without him; he gave me courage, advice, and jumpstarted my life as a coder. I cannot thank you enough, 爸爸 《3
