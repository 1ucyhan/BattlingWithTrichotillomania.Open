<b> Battle With TRICHOTILLOMANIA - beat the hair pulling disorder </b>

<b> by Lucy Han </b>

Trichotillomania is a <b> hair-pulling disorder </b> that <b> four out of 100 people </b> in this world. This hair pulling can cause many negative effects both mentally and physically.This can range from small detectable areas to total baldness. The scalp is the most common area, followed by the eyelashes and eyebrows.

See some uncomfortable but absolutely real images from Google for <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=trichotillomania&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS876US876&sxsrf=AOaemvLZJZnr3KshE7kKWrgymhOlkGZ6sw:1632878061822&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiH9NfmgKPzAhWdDjQIHTokAJIQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=2560&bih=1432&dpr=1"> TRICHOTILLOMANIA </a></b>

<b> HARMFUL EFFECTS: </b>
* Increased feelings of depression and anxiety
* Low self esteem.
* Poor body image due to hair loss and. skin damage.
* Negative emotions; shame, etc

<b> NO CERTAIN CAUSE:</b> 
* Stress and anxiety makes it worse.
* May be related to OCD.
* Could have been passed on genetically

<b> Some Tips </b> (per my research & experience, might or might not work. The mark <b> * = I have personally tried these; ** = Most helpful </b> )
* Wear a bandana to bed. *
* Reward yourself after several days (or hours) of being pull free. *
* Be patient with yourself.
* Join a support group.
* Talk to another person with Trichotillomania.
* Wet down your hair. This will make it really hard to pull out your hair since it will be slippery.
* Buy a fidget toy. *
* Find other things to do with your hands such as knitting, crocheting, or cross stitch.
* <b>Imagine your life without Trichotillomania and with hair.**</b> 
* Wear a hoodie to bed as a barrier to pulling.
* <b>Help others, which in turn will help you. ** </b>
* Watch shows and documentaries about trichotillomania to learn new techniques.*
* <b> Read everything you can on the internet about trichotillomania and the treatment plans to deal with it. **</b>


"Battle With TRICHOTILLOMANIA" App was built based on the items which have "DOUBLE-Stars" based on my research and personal experience/suffering: 
* You will find your <b> personal secured history of TRICHOTILLOMANIA records</b>, with images, your own ranking stars (to avoid see the image too much and feel depressed) with timestamp, again, knowing the trend is very very important, only you can access such info.
* You can also <b> find fellows who sufferred similar pain as you</b>, and you can <b> chat with them securely </b>, by text, or image, or video, let's help each other!

Also I am doing some AI research, hope to enable AI-based emotion detection and tracking records pattern recognition to be "Smarter" -:)

Starting with some tips as I learned to WIN over this bad monster, and hope to get more friends to join the TRICHOTILLOMANIA-Beating Fun!
